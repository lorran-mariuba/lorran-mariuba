Hi, I'm Lorran Mariúba de Oliveira and I'm Software Developer at Bank Sicoob. 
I’m interested in send my new projects about systems development. Learn from other projects which are in the GitHub. 
I’m currently learning Java, Ruby on Rails, more about HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. 
I’m looking to collaborate in projects from people who are starting their careers in systems development. 
About my projects, I hope people can help me improve my knowledge and my projects, giving me some tips and show me my weakness in software development.

You can reach me on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorran-mariuba).

That's it!

Let's code!
